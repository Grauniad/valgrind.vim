Valgrind (http://developer.kde.org/~sewardj/) is an open-source memory debugger for x86-GNU/Linux. This script allows you to start valgrind from vim and easily jump to errors it reports.

This version has been enhanced to provide keys to move up and down the current call stack, and to make it behave more sensibly when it is re-run (it will attempt to re-use the same window)

See the comments in the beginning of the script for some documentation.
