Valgrind (http://developer.kde.org/~sewardj/) is an open-source memory debugger for x86-GNU/Linux. This script allows you to start valgrind from vim and easily jump to error it reports.

The script output is not very beautiful yet, but I find it already useful.

See the comments in the beginning of the script for some documentation.
